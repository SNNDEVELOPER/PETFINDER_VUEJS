 # PETFINDERPLUGIN - VUEJS VERSION

This plugin uses VUEJS, http://www.vuejs.org. If you are looking for a vanilla JS option see tmy petfinderplugin instead.

Petfinder has transitioned away from their v1 API to a v2 API that uses OAUTH. This basic plugin will help you get started on your way to getting data from Petfinder and displaying it on your webpages. 


# GETTING STARTED

1. Request a API license and secret from Petfinder by visiting https://www.petfinder.com/developers/

2. Open /getpets/getpets.php and add your API Key, Secret and shelter ID provided from the link above

3. Petfinder has limits on API requests - The mixin - getPets.php - requires a endpoint to call in order to populate pet data. 

4. Set your production path in vue.config.js for your build

4. Have fun!
